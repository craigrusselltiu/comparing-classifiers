# Comparing Classifiers

This study aims to showcase the potential of statistical-based learning on real world
applications. In particular, the predictive power of algorithms like Na√Øve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor
are highlighted by creating classifiers for the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The study could be the key
to uncovering crucial information about diabetes not only in the Pima heritage, but perhaps globally
as well, improving predictability and allowing for early countermeasures to be taken to prevent it.
